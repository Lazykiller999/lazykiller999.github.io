						<h2>Things about me</h2>
						<p>Hi there! My name is Julio, and I'm an aspiring games developer. I have always had a passion
							for games since I was a child. Playing games has been an important part of my life and has
							helped shape me into who I am today.

							As a child, I loved immersing myself in different worlds and stories, and video games
							provided me with an escape from the real world. I was fascinated by how games could take me
							on exciting adventures, solve puzzles, and test my skills.

							What I didn't realize back then was that playing games was helping me develop important life
							skills. Games taught me to think creatively, work well under pressure, and approach
							challenges with a positive attitude. These skills have been invaluable to me in my personal
							and professional life.

							I bring that same passion and enthusiasm for problem-solving and creativity to my work. I am
							always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

							Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you will enjoy getting to know me and my work a
							little better.

						<h2>My future</h2>
						<p>As a passionate and dedicated game developer, my goal is to create an immersive and
							innovative gaming experiences that challenge and engage players. With expertise in
							programming languages such as C++ and Unity, I bring a strong technical background to every
							project I work on.

							My creative vision is centered around designing games that push the boundaries of what is
							possible, while still delivering an enjoyable and memorable player experience. From my
							projects (that are listed below), I have demonstrated my ability to bring a unique and
							distinctive voice to the world of gaming.

							I am always seeking new opportunities to grow as a game developer, and I am eager to
							contribute my skills and passion to any project that aligns with my aspirations. If you are
							interested in learning more about my experience and abilities, I would be happy to hear from
							you.</p>
